# pylos
Pylos is a web-based repository for sharable computational design, environmental, and sustainable analysis tools, components, definitions, plugins, and other bits known as blocks. It was inspired by Blocks and Hydrashare and is currently maintained by the computational design group and PPT at ZGF Architects.
